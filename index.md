I am a software engineer at Google London working on [Android](https://www.android.com) and [Chrome](https://www.chromium.org).
Most of my work has been around building infrastructure for [Nearby Share](https://blog.google/products/android/nearby-share/)
across Chrome and Android, and working on Android OS to support new revolutionary devices such as foldables.

Previously, I was very interested in algorithms and algorithmic competitions. I have received awards from computer science veterans like [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://www.stroustrup.com), won multiple programming competitions at national and international levels, ranked #16 twice in ACM ICPC and am ranked #2 in India on HackerRank.
