I am a software engineer at Google London working on [Android](https://www.android.com) and [Chrome](https://www.chromium.org).
Most of my work has been around building infrastructure for [Nearby Share](https://blog.google/products/android/nearby-share/)
across Chrome and Android, and working on Android OS to support new revolutionary devices such as foldables.

Previously, I was very interested in algorithms and algorithmic competitions. I have received multiple awards
(including one from Bjarne Stroustroup, the inventor of C++), ranked #16 twice in ACM ICPC and mentored students
interested in informatics olympiad (IOI).

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/himanshujaju/) for anything.
